## Introductions

### App and Group Brief

### Bryce

Hello everyone. We'll talk about our project in a minute here but first we'll introduce ourselves.

I'm Bryce, I started programming while I was in engineering at UVic, and I've found it more fulfilling than the jobs I've had since, so this program seemed like a good next step for me.

### Jon

Hi, I'm Jon. I completed a degree in math from Queen's university, and have been teaching math since as a job and programming as a hobby, and I decided to go to the lighthouse labs bootcamp to move into a web development career.

### Wilson

Hello, I'm Wilson. I'm a graduate from UVic as an engineer and pivoted to web development after, where I worked as a dev for three years.

## App Explanation

### Intro (Bryce)

Our project is TraderU, a stock and cryptocurrency trading simulator. We'll go into details about the tools and techniques used towards the end of the presentation.

Let's try it out.

Thanks everyone.
